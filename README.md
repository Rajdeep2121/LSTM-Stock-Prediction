Long Short Term Memory(LSTMs) are a type of recurrent neural networks used for making predictions, classifying and processing based on time series. These are special types of neural nets that have feedback connections(basically we can say that it has memory).

A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.
